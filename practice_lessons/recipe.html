<h1>Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese</h1>
<h2>Steps</h2>


<ol>
<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
<li>Cut wings and legs off rotisserie chicken. Skin and bone wings and legs; chop or shred dark meat into bite-size pieces.</li>
<li>Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Whisk in flour gradually until a thick paste forms. Cook until golden, about 1 minute. Pour in milk, whisking constantly, until thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute more. Reduce heat and season sauce with black pepper.</li>
<li>Stir Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese into the sauce until melted and combined. Stir in hot sauce, adjusting to reach desired level of spiciness. Add blue cheese, chicken, and macaroni; mix well to combine.</li>
