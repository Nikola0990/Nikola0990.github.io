   <div class="body">
This collection was created 
with a combination of 
different illustrater files. There were restrictions 
placed on what the maker
places on the files. The only 
elements used were circles ,
trianges, and squares. 
With these elements we as the 
viewers can see that something 
simple can become dynamic and
engaging with just colors 
and simple shapes.
