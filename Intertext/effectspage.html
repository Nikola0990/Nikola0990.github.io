Shame, Anxiety, and Depression:
<br>
According to objectification theory, the internalization of sexual objectification leads to constant self-monitoring, creating a state of self-consciousness that breeds feelings of shame and anxiety. Newer studies support this assertion, finding that self-objectification is in fact correlated with higher rates of body shame and appearance anxiety. Furthermore, recent research also shows that sexual objectification in the form of stranger harassment can be a source of anxiety if it inflames underlying fears of victimization and rape . The feelings of shame and anxiety resulting from self-objectification have been found to subsequently lead to depression . Prolonged exposure to sexual objectification may also contribute to insidious trauma which is marked by psychological trauma symptoms that occur due to lifelong exposure to microaggressions , as opposed to one large trauma. Some of the psychological symptoms found to be associated with the trauma of sexual objectification include anxiety and depression . Unfortunately, depression may not be the end of the correlational chain in the context of sexual objectification, as it has also been found to be related to disordered eating among women.

  Eating Disorders:
  <br>
  Multiple studies have found a relationship between sexual objectification and disordered eating. Harned found that sexual harassment, which is often comprised of sexually objectifying behaviors, was a significant predictor of most disordered eating symptoms, even after controlling for previous physically violent sexual experiences. Supporting the findings of Harned, a study done by Augustus-Horvath and Tylka found that self-objectification is positively correlated with body shame, and body shame is correlated with greater tendencies toward maladaptive eating habits . Even self-objectifying women who report to enjoy being sexualized have still been found to engage in negative eating attitudes . Self-objectification and its possible outcomes of depression and disordered eating may in turn hinder women’s overall productivity.

  <div class="experiences">
  Objectification theory posits that constant objectification creates a continuous stream of anxiety-provoking experiences, requiring women to maintain at least part of their concentration on their physical appearance and safety at all times in order to better anticipate the perceptions and actions of others . The self-objectification and self-consciousness that results from experiencing sexual objectification may diminish women’s peak motivational states , or what Csikszentmihalyi (1990) refers to as “flow.” Flow occurs when a situation requiring mental attention is perceived as challenging, but the skills required to meet the challenge are perceived as high, resulting in a highly productive and enjoyable experience. These states are marked by a loss of self-consciousness because all mental energy is focused purely on the task and not on the existence of self. Women who self-objectify are less likely to experience the undivided attention characteristic of flow because part of their attention is always dedicated to physical self-monitoring; and therefore they may experience reduced rates of productivity and general life enjoyment.

"Eating disorders are much more prevalent with women who see themselves as sex objects as well as well as body shame. We see male attention as the holy grail of our existance and so we compete with other women for our own self esteem."

"Viewing ourselves as sex objects causes depressed cognitive functioning.If we are engaging in habitual body monitoring it simply takes up more mental space that could be better used completing math tests. It just sucks! It lowers self esteem , lowers GPA's, lowers political officiency and the beleif you have a voice in politics. It also causes you to not get along with other womem;it harms women politically, personally, and professionally."
