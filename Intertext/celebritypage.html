She has also stated that for most women and girls, size zero is not healthy or attractive and therefore should not be sought after. Rihanna urges girls not to feel pressure from the fashion industry to be thin.

"You have to just accept your body. You may not love it all the way, but you just have to be comfortable with it, comfortable with knowing that that’s your body. You just want something else that someone else has, but that doesn’t mean what you have isn’t beautiful, because people always want what you have, and you always want what they have — no one is ever 100 per cent like, ‘Yes, I'm the bomb dot com — from head to toe!""
