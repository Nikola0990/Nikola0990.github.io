<h3> Arial is Everywhere! </h3>
<br>
<p>
Arial, sometimes marketed or displayed in software as Arial MT, is a <a href="https://designschool.canva.com/blog/typography-terms/">san-serif</a> typeface and set of computer fonts. Fonts from the Arial family are packaged with all versions of Microsoft Windows from Windows 3.1 onwards, some other Microsoft software applications,Apple Mac OS X and many PostScript 3 computer printers.The typeface was designed in 1982 by a 10-person team, led by <a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/robin-nicholas">Robin Nicholas</a> and <a href="http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-33011.html">Patricia Saunders</a>,for Monotype Typography. It was created to be metrically identical to the popular typeface Helvetica, with all character widths identical, so that a document designed in Helvetica could be displayed and printed correctly without having to pay for a Helvetica license.
