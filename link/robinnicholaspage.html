In 1965 he went to train in the Type Drawing Office (TDO) of Monotype, at that time still primarily an engineering company making hot metal typesetting machines. He has been with the company ever since, witnessing the revolutions brought about by phototypesetting and digital technology, and the company’s bankruptcy in the 1990s. For ten years Nicholas was manager of the Type Drawing Office. Until his retirement this year he was head of typography for Monotype in the UK.
