After five long years of so-called “burning my eyebrows,” I could not find a decent job commensurate to my degree. Then, there was gender discrimination, and the requirement of a long experience in the field of study, which I did not have. After many years of working some odd - jobs in the country, I found it very unsubstantial for my family. 
<br>
<br>
Then, there was the sad truth that my husband had an affair with another woman. It was late when I found out that he had another family.
<br>
<br>
These dilemmas pushed me to try applying for work overseas, hopeful to earn much more than I was getting here and to get away from the pain of losing my husband. Only my younger sister knew of my plans. It was my sister, to whom I entrusted my 2 daughters, aged five and two years old.
<br>
<br>
It took me almost four months applying for the post of a factory worker before I was finally hired: from the agency’s local interview, to the processing of pertinent documents like passport, NBI and police clearance, medical examination, trade test, and others. I almost spent the whole separation pay of my sister for all the fees and still needed to borrow more for the placement fee, amounting to PhP80,000 or almost US$2,000. 
<br>
<br>
As the agency was collecting in advance such amount even before the working visa is processed, I was fortunate to have been selected in the 2nd batch of workers for United States, as there were hundreds of applicants lined up in that single day of interview by the owner of an electronics company! My heart was almost torn into pieces for some girls who paid in full but were not selected. I found out that the money they gave to the agency was loaned by their parents. “Nagsangla kami ng lupa, nagbenta ng mga kalabaw,” they said. (We mortgaged our land, sold the carabaos). 
<br>
<br>
Securing pertinent requirements from our government agencies was also disappointing as the process of application was unsystematic. To add to our woes, there were the unexpected and frequent brown- outs that delayed our business with them. We had no choice but to return the following day.
<br>
<br>
With regards to the Pre-departure orientation seminar (PDOS) conducted, I could not remember any significant topic discussed. All I can recall is the discussion on the requirements in applying for an automated teller machine (ATM) card both for the worker and for the family left behind, and the “house and lot” advertisement and how to avail of discounts.
<br>
<br>
Finally, when it was time for me to depart for Unites States, the mother’s heart in me was torn into pieces. I could not bear to see my two little girls crying as I disengaged myself away from their embraces. As I was walking away from them, I could hear them crying. Yet, there was nothing I could do. I had to be strong and determined to go.
<br>
<br>
The working hours at the factory are from 8am to 8pm. But often, we were asked to work until 12 midnight! That schedule went on for 6 months and we did not have any day off! But when I finished paying all my debts at home, I demanded for a Sunday day off which made the management raise their eyebrows.
<br>
<br>
Even though I was not yet aware of my rights as a migrant worker at that time, I insisted to be given a day off on Sundays. I discussed it daringly with my superiors and supervisors telling them that even machines need to be shut off or they shall explode from overheat. I was fortunate that they relented to my request, although some supervisors of other departments disagreed and even told me that I have to leave my faith in God in the Philippines and not to bring it to United States. 
<br>
<br>
Our house quarters were not fully ventilated because the air conditioned rooms were reserved for the Thai workers and for some Filipino-Chinese workers. This is not right so I confronted our supervisor. I told him, “How do you expect me to perform well at work if I could not sleep and rest well because of the dismal conditions of our rooms?” I demanded the keys to the air conditioned rooms, reserved for the local workers. 
<br>
<br>
Fortunately, my supervisor gave in, as he well understood the point I was trying to make. A few of my fellow Filipino women workers did not agree with me because they were afraid. But, we have to speak up in order for change to happen. Living in these illegal working conditions is not right.
