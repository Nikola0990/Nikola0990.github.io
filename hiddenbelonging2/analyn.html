Meet Analyn (not her true name), who is one of the many persons whose life I have witnessed. Her experience made me think and touched my heart, perhaps explaining why many Filipinas feel they must suffer in exchange of a better life for family.  To make her eligible for emigration, a relative who worked as a Philippine diplomat to Canada agreed to sponsor her. For a couple of years, she worked as the all around domestic worker, then crossed the U.S. border to Ohio, to work for the ambassador’s daughter.  A high school graduate, she was in her early 40’s when she left the Philippines.
<br>
<br>
In 2005, a close friend of mine from the Philippines told me about Maria, adding that she was overworked and isolated.  Analyn wanted to move to New York, my friend said, and she wanted help finding a better job and  a  new start. Actually, Analyns’s family was distantly related to me, although I could not remember if I ever had met Maria. Nevertheless, I did not hesitate to help because we shared the same experience of being exploited.
<br>
<br>
My friend gave her my phone number.  I found myself talking to an extremely stressed out woman who worked for grueling seven days a week, on duty for up to 20 hours a day. She barely slept. She said she was an all-around domestic worker, a nanny to one child and a caregiver to a bedridden elderly woman. She had to clean two cars and cook the family’s meals outside the house during winter because her employer wants to avoid food odors inside.
<br>
<br>
I heard her shivering while cooking in the cold and talking to me on the phone. For almost two years, all I did was listen to her agonies and I gave her advice as her peer.
<br>
<br>
I suggested that she should leave, if she felt that work had been too much. She started complaining about her sore arm from assisting the 200-pound, bedridden grandmother. Her salary was $600 a month, clearly less than minimum wage, and tiny when considering all the chores that she did in the house and her long hours. It felt as if she were imprisoned as a slave; as she told it, to leave would be as if she were escaping from prison.
<br>
<br>
She said she was terrified about complaining because the family was powerful. Her employers were well-known as a very religious couple. They worked as doctors in the community, and no one would believe her story of abuse.
<br>
<br>
Feeling depressed, Maria wanted to go back to the Philippines. I encouraged her to come to New York where she could stay with me in my small room until she found a job.  But I thought it was impossible.  I can tell from the way she talked to me that she was both naive and petrified. Any person who suffers abuse for a long time loses self-confidence and sense of direction.
<br>
<br>
Upon my suggestion during our long conversations over the phone, Analyn befriended the two caregivers of the grandmother from the Home Health for the Elderly. They and another friend who knew she felt abused were her only contacts in Ohio. I advised Analyn to tell the two health workers of her bad situation and ask for help to escape. Maria said she did not know even how to get a cab, nevermind a bus ticket.
<br>
<br>
For two months, Analyn remained silent, working with the local friends. They gave her a one-way ticket to New York City on a Greyhound bus, money for a cab and instructions on how to get to the bus going to New York. The two health workers asked if she wanted to file charges against her employers but Maria refused because they were relatives and she did not want any scandal. 
<br>
<br>
 

At the local bus station in Ohio, a police officer stayed with her until the bus left.  Maria told me she was so scared. She carried a small luggage and shoulder bag and wore pajamas and sandals when I met her on Lexington Avenue. When I saw Maria I wanted to hug her. She looked exhausted. She told me she could no longer take the abuse, so she had escaped.
<br>
<br>
I shared my room with her and asked my friends to help her find a job.
<br>
<br>
I was impressed at how the Filipino community responded positively when they learned about her ordeal. Maybe it was because many of us we can all relate to her experience. Everyone advised her to be optimistic.  We have to be intrepid to make everything fall into place, even that means starting again from scratch.
<br>
<br>
Analyn is finally free, although her diplomatic visa has expired, and she is off-status or undocumented. But that’s another story. The most important thing is she was able to free herself from the bondage of servitude and abuse.
