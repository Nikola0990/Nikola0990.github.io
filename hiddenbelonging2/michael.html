I came to Brooklyn about twenty years ago after winning a greencard.I was very happy to win the greencard because I knew that the pay was better in American then it was in Germany. I came to New York and lived in a crammed apartment with 7 other poeple that came here because of work. It was tough. The poeple I was living were all sleeping in a 2 bedroom apartment. We all had to pitch in for rent but there were days were I wouldnt even have a full meal becuase I worked 12 hours a day. I worked in a construction site and got paid about 8 dollars an hour. For me that was a step up from what I received in Germany. I didnt know that the pay was actually not what I was supposed to be receiving for the amount of work I was doing. The work was strenous and I came home exhausted just waiting for Sunday to come. I also worked Saturdays to gain more money. What I didnt know was that the pay I was receiving and the amount of hours in work was for nothing. I didnt know poeple here earned over 15 hours an hour for such a strenous job. Here I was working 12 hours and working on Saturdays for possible the same pay as someone working 5 days a week for only 7 hours. Later after communcating with people I became aquinted with I found out that I was not in the right place . I was getting used for cheap labour. If I knew of my labor rights I would have not put my mental and physical health in danger but without knowldge of the rules I was placed in a unhealthy working enviroment.
