      I started decorating the bathroom in 2000 when I moved in to this house. The tins of paint are still on display 12 years later and the work awaits completion. I still haven't decided what colour towels I'm having. <br> <br>

      I'm still getting round to putting the optic-fibre Christmas tree away from last December and it's now nearly September. As it got past the halfway mark of this year (June) I decided I might as well leave it because (a) it's nearly Christmas again anyway (b) I quite like the effect of the lights (c) what's wrong with having a Christmas tree throughout the year anyway? (d) I really can't be bothered to fiddle around putting it in and out of the loft every year. Polly <br> <br> <b> - Day, Abingdon</b> <br>

      A client sent me a cheque for Â£6,000. I lost it. I always intended to ask them to issue another but never got round to it.<br> <br> <b>Ian Bain, Edinburgh</b>

When I was asked to write a 2,000-word history essay for my architecture degree, I waited to the last week to act. I decided to set all my other tasks aside so I could wholly focus on the essay. I locked myself in my room, and yet for the first six days I only wrote 100 words each day. My piano and guitar improved loads and I saw a lot of good movies but this was not what I had been planning. It was only when the stress of a deadline and the possible retake of the module reached breaking point on the last day that I managed to complete the last 1,400 words. What this showed me is that it is possible but I wish that I was motivated by something other than stress. <br> <br> <b> - Theo Roseland, Bristol</b>

My husband and I still haven't put our house in Holland on the market, or told anyone that we want to sell. We lived there for 20 years and moved back to a rental in the UK when our children came to university here. To the neighbours' bafflement, the house has been standing unused, unemptied and untended for over two years and we've hardly been back. But none of us mentions it, except that my son would like his drum kit at uni. Worries about break-ins, burglary or squatting occupy my thoughts, as well as dwindling value as it ages. Why are we so paralyzed? <br> <br> <b> - Vivian Thonger, Bude, Cornwall</b>

      I THINK <br>

      THE REAL QUESTION IS... <br>

      WHY IS EVERYONE SO LAZY...?
    </p>

    In 1970 I moved house, dismantling my well-organised workbench. I then spent the next 30 years putting back reassembling it. I was forever hunting for a tool, screw, fuse... looking in a variety of boxes and shelves. I would spend 10 to 20 minutes on each search. Finally, 30 years later, I got to grips and put everything back in its place. I was astonished it only took me 45 minutes. At two 10 minutes searches a month that makes an incredible 120 hours solid work, or three 40-hour weeks. I cannot believe this except that figures don't lie. <br> <br> <b> - Leon Laporte, London</b>
