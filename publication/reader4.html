      "BEST"<br>
      WAYS <br>
      TO WASTE<br>
      TIME <br>
     </h1>

  <h2>IN SCHOOL.. <br> IN WORK..  <br> ANYWHERE <br>
  WOULD WORK ! </h2>

    
    <p>
      Procrastination is like a full time job to some people.<br><br>

Honestly, it’s extraordinary… the lengths some will go to, to avoid work!<br><br>

Are YOU a culprit? Do you find yourself getting distracted by weird and wonderful things? Or (goodness forbid) Facebook?

Don’t worry – everyone does it.

    <h2>CREATIVE <br> PROCRASINATION </h2>


    <p>
      1. Origami. Could you make this elephant?<br><br>

2. Practice your signature. You could be famous one day – do you really want your autograph to be a scrawl and a squiggle with a smiley face?<br> <br>

3. Write a poem. Get those creative juices flowing with a poem about anything you like; you could even enter it into a writing competition (too far?).<br> <br>

4. Plan your Halloween costume. So what if it is months away? Start planning now and your outfit could be truly amazing.<br> <br>

5. Draw a picture of your team. Take doodling to a whole new level with a beautiful masterpiece. Your boss might be so impressed that they hang it on the fridge…<br> <br>

6. Create a secret handshake. Then decide who has the honour of sharing it with you.<br> <br>

</p>

<h2>CHALENGE <br> YOURSELF </h2>


<p>

7. Try writing with your wrong hand. Even better; try and do it without anyone else noticing!<br> <br>

8. Hold your breath. How long you can do it for? (Do try not to pass out though – that’s possibly taking it all a little bit too far).<br><br>

9. Learn to speak Pirate. Or elvish, or Shyriiwook (Wookie) or whichever fictional language you might fancy.<br> <br>

10. Start a debate. Sit back and relax, while a battle of the brains commences across the office.<br> <br>

11. Office rowing. Challenge one of the other teams to an office rowing race.<br><br>

12. Create a “things to do before I die” list. This could be some seriously life changing stuff.<br> <br>

13. Get a song stuck in everyone’s heads. See how many people you can get to hum a catchy song, by subliminally planting it in their mind. And repeat.<br><br>
    </p>

      
      <h2> INSPORATIONAL <br> PROCRASINATION </h2>


    <p>
  14. Tweet some inspirational quotes. It’s great for your company brand (depending on what you deem ‘inspirational,’ obviously).<br><br>

15. Create an inspirational playlist. Watch your productivity soar as you’re listening to motivational anthems like ‘working 9-5’ and ‘don’t stop believing.’<br> <br>

16. Find a new, inspirational computer wallpaper. Whether it’s your favourite quote, a family photo or an entrepreneur you look up to, feel inspired every time you switch your computer on or off.<br> <br>

17. Read an inspirational blog. Perhaps, one on how to be more productive… or one that inspires your entrepreneurial spirit!

    <h2>  FUN <br> PROCRASINATION </h2>

<p>
18. Prank a colleague. It doesn’t have to be April Fool’s Day to play a trick on your unsuspecting co-workers – click here to check out some of the best!<br> <br>

19. Eat something. Food is life. What better way to distract ourselves than tucking into a cupcake or (for the healthier people amongst you) a banana.<br><br>

20. Spam a colleague. Email them repeatedly with the lyrics of a well-known song, one line at a time.<br><br>

21. Funny cat videos. Everyone loves these don’t they? Just one can brighten up your day – and they actually make you more productive in the long run, apparently. Check it out.<br> <br>

22. Play ‘would you rather’ with a colleague. This could get interesting (or terrifying)…<br><br>

23. Exercise. Yes, you could be doing exercise, right now, at your desk. Click here to find out how.<br><br>

24. Check Facebook. Just in case, you know, something really, really, really important happened in the last ten minutes.

<h2>PRODUCTIVE <br>PROCRASINATIOM </h2>
<p>
25. Purge your inbox. Got thousands of unopened emails (probably spam)? Clear them out and move everything into neat little folders. It feels so GREAT when it’s done!<br><br>

26. Write a list. Of all the things you should be doing. Then you can start ticking things off (feels great) starting with the smaller items if that’s what you prefer.<br><br>

27. Watch some sort of educational video. You’ll find pretty much everything you want on the internet, is there something you could do with learning/improving/developing? (Check out TED for some inspiration).<br><br>

28. Plan a social event. Employee engagement is a huge deal at the moment and putting on a social event will help to boost it – making staff happier and more hardworking. (But it’s also really fun)!<br><br>

29. Take a nap! Studies have actually shown that taking a nap at work can actually boost energy, focus and productivity!<br><br>
