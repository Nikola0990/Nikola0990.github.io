    <h1>
      REAL <br> 
      LIFE
      ACHEIVE-
      MENTS
      
     </h1>


  <h2> OK I'VE DONE 10 <br> MINUTES OF WORK. <br> TIME FOR A BREAK. </h2>

    <h3>
     When you make that brave first step into the unknown.
     </h3>

      <h3>
     When your teacher underestimates your power.
     </h3>

<h3>
     When your pen runs out of ink and it could only mean one thing.
     </h3>

     <h3>
     When you engage in a little productive procrastination.
     </h3>

<h3>
     When you simply want to ensure that you're well rested before starting.
     </h3>


<h3>
     When you give a new meaning to "multitasking".
     </h3>

     <h3>
     When you completely outdo yourself in your ability to do nothing.
     </h3>

<h3>
     When panic sets in early and actually pays off.
     </h3>
