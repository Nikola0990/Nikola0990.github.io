<h2> Biography </h2>

<p>
Adrian Frutiger was born on May 24, 1928, in Unterseen, Canton of Bern to weaver parents. At the very young age, he began experimenting with stylized handwriting and invented scripts, defying the formal, cursive penmanship then taught at Swiss schools. His interest in sculpturing was not met with very encouraging views by his father and teachers. However, they supported the idea of him going into print. Consequently, he entered the world of print yet kept his love for sculpturing alive by incorporating the sculpture designs in his typefaces. He began his apprenticeship, at the age of sixteen, as a compositor to the printer Otto Schaerffli, for four years. He also attended school of applied arts, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?biw=1280&bih=726&q=Kunstgewerbeschule+in+Z%C3%BCrich&npsic=0&rflfq=1&rlha=0&rllag=47376305,8512895,1572&tbm=lcl&ved=0ahUKEwjG_Nup9c_WAhXGJiYKHSRVAs0QtgMINA&tbs=lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:2&rldoc=1#rlfi=hd:;si:;mv:!1m3!1d16042.003715505056!2d8.51262185!3d47.37660265!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i262!2i285!4f13.1;tbs:lrf:!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e3!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:2
">Kunstgewerbeschule in Zürich</a>. Here he thrived under the supervision of art instructors like <a href="https://www.linotype.com/793-12659/walterkchstypedesignclasses.html">Walter Käch</a> and Alfred Willimann. Frutiger studied monumental inscriptions from Roman forum rubbings, although he primarily focused on calligraphy rather than drafting tools.

<h3> Typeface Journey </h3>
<br>
<p>
In 1954, Frutiger’s first commercial typeface Président was released. It was designed in a manner that showcased a set of titling capital letters with small, <a href="https://designschool.canva.com/blog/typography-terms/"> bracketed serifs </a>. It was followed by Ondine, a calligraphic, informal, script face which translated as Wave in French. Then Méridien appeared the following year, illustrating a glyphic, old-style, <a href="https://designschool.canva.com/blog/typography-terms/"> serif</a> text face. The typefaces were inspired by Nicholas Jenson’s work. Frutiger clearly demonstrated his ideas of letter construction, unity, and organic form in Méridien. In a few years, he designed <a href="https://designschool.canva.com/blog/typography-terms/">slab serif</a> typefaces. Egyptienne was one of those typefaces that had him commissioned for photocomposition.


During early 1970s, upon the request of the public transport authority of Paris, Frutiger inspected the Paris Metro signage. Moreover, he recreated Univers typeface in a variant font. It was a set of capitals and numbers designed for white-on-dark-blue backgrounds visible especially under poor lighting. Upon the successful reception of this modern typeface, the French airport authority commissioned him yet again to work for the new Charles de Gaulle International Airport. He was required to design a way-finding signage alphabet and in such way that is both legible from afar and from any angle. Frutiger first decided to adapt <a href="file:///Users/Niki/Desktop/test_project/univers_typeface.html">Univers</a> typeface but then relinquished the idea considering a little outdated. He took a different approach to the matter and altered the Univers typeface and fused it with organic influences of the Eric Gill’s Gill Sans typeface. The resultant typeface was originally titled, Roissy, though it was named after Frutiger in 1976, when it was released for public use.
